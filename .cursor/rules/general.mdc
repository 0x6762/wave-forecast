# General Rules

## Principles
- Prioritize simplicity, performance, and user experience
- Avoid blocking the main thread
- Consistent error handling and user feedback
- Follow established patterns in the codebase

## Error Handling
- Always wrap async operations in try-catch blocks
- Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
- Log errors with stack traces in debug mode
- Handle loading and error states in UI

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use comments for "why", not "what"
- Prefer composition over inheritance
