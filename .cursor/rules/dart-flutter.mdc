# Dart & Flutter Best Practices

## Dart Conventions
- Use `const` constructors wherever possible
- Declare variables as `final` when they won't change
- Prefer `late` over nullable for required fields initialized later
- Use named parameters for better code clarity
- Use `??` and `?.` for null safety

## Widget Best Practices
- Prefer `StatelessWidget` over `StatefulWidget` when possible
- Extract reusable widgets into separate classes
- Use `const` constructors to optimize rebuilds
- Use proper widget keys when needed (lists, reorderable items)

## Async & Performance
- Use `FutureBuilder` and `StreamBuilder` for async data
- Avoid heavy operations in `build()` methods
- Use `async`/`await` instead of `.then()` chains
- Consider `compute()` for CPU-intensive operations

## Code Organization
- One widget per file for complex components
- Group related widgets in the same file if simple
- Keep build methods clean and readable
- Extract complex widget trees into methods or widgets

## Common Patterns
- Separation between presentation and business logic
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service classes for complex operations
- Extension methods for utility functions
